## Finishing Up Repeated Interaction

### Other interesting strategies

- Is grim trigger the only way to enforce the cooperative outcome?

   - As it turns out, no

- Tit-for-tat

- Pavlovs dogs (aka Win-Stay Lose-Switch)

- [Others](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/prisoner-dilemma/strategy-table.html) (not all support cooperative play as a SPNE)

### Other games

- We ask similar questions about other simultaneous-move games played infinitely

- They are interesting, but we will restrict ourselves to PD (and similar) games, for the most part

- Let $a<0$. Consider the function $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$

         linetype = 2)
   ```
   
- For the next set of games we will be looking at, we need to know how to find the maximum value that this parabola obtains
::::

### Remember the quadratic formula?

- For a quadratic given by $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$, the roots can be found using the quadratic formula:
   $$x = \frac{-b\pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$

   - This gives us the $\hat{x}$ values for which $f(\hat{x})=0$

- As it turns out, the $x^{*}$ value which maximizes $f(x)$ is halfway between these points

- Using some math, we can find the midpoint between the two roots

   - If $\hat{x}_1$ and $\hat{x}_2$ are the parabola's roots (found via the quadratic equation), then 

      $$x^{*}=\frac{1}{2}(\hat{x}_1 + \hat{x}_2) = -\frac{b}{2a}$$


### The maximum of a quadratic

- So, given a quadratic of the form $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$,
   
   - The value which maximizes $f$ (called the [maximizer]{.alert} or [arg. maximum]{.hi}), $x^{*}$, is given by 
      $$x^{*}=\frac{-b}{2a}$$

   - The maximum _value_ of $f$ is given by $f(x^{*})$

      - With some math, we can show that 
         $$ f(x^{*}) = c - \frac{b^2}{4a}$$

- Remark: you're going to need to know how to get the maximum as well as the arg. max, so finding $x^{*}$ and plugging it in to $f$ is good practice


### Ex 0 

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width=50%}
- Recall our parabola from earlier: $f(x)=-2x^2+10x+0$

- The arg. max: 
   $$\frac{-10}{2(-2)}=\frac{10}{4}=2.5$$

- The function's maximum:

   $$f(x^{*})=-2(2.5)^2+10(2.5)=12.5$$

### Ex 1

- Let 
   $$\pi = (100 - q_1 - q_2) q_1 - 10q_1$$

- Find the $q_1$ which maximizes $\pi$, and report the function maximum

. . . 

- Rewrite $\pi$ as 
   $$\pi(q_1) = -q_1^2 + (90 - q_2)q_1$$

- What's $a$, $b$, and $c$?
   - $a=-1$, $b=90-q_2$, and $c=0$

- Therefore, the arg. max is given by 

   $$q_1^{*}=\frac{-(90-q_2)}{-2}=\frac{90-q_2}{2}$$

### Ex 1 (solved)

:::{.nonincremental}
- Let 
   $$\pi = (100 - q_1 - q_2) q_1 - 10q_1$$

- Find the $q_1$ which maximizes $\pi$, and report the function maximum

:::

- The arg. max is given by 

   $$q_1^{*}=\frac{-(90-q_2)}{-2}=\frac{90-q_2}{2}$$

- The maximum $\pi$ is then given by

   $$\pi^{*}=-\frac{(90-q_2)^2}{-4}=\frac{(90-q_2)^{2}}{4}$$

### Alternative: Use Calculus

- If you have seen any introductory calculus, you can recall that we can just use the power rule and a bit of algebra to find the maximum of $f(x)=ax^2 + bx + c$

- [Kahn Academy on the Power Rule](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/old-ap-calculus-ab/ab-derivative-rules/ab-diff-negative-fraction-powers/a/power-rule-review)

   $$\frac{d}{dx}c\cdot x^n = c(n \cdot x^{n-1})$$

- So 

   $$f'(x)=2ax + b$$

- To find the maximum (an extreme value), we set $f'(x)=0$:

   $$2ax+b=0\ \implies\ x=\frac{-b}{2a}$$

### Ex 2

- Let 
   $$\pi = (100 - 2q_1 - q_2) q_1 - 25q_1  - 10$$

- Find the $q_1$ which maximizes $\pi$, and report the function maximum

. . . 

- Rewrite $\pi$ as 
   $$\pi(q_1) = -2q_1^2 + (75 - q_2)q_1 - 10$$

- What's $\frac{d\pi}{dq_{1}}$?

   - $\pi'= -4q_1 + 75 - q_2$

### Ex 2 (Solved)
- To get the arg. max, set this $\pi'$ to 0 and solve for $q_1$:
   $$
   \begin{aligned}
   0 &= -4q_1 + 75 - q_2\\
   4q_1 &= 75 - q_2\\
   q_1^{*} &= \frac{75-q_2}{4}
   \end{aligned}
   $$

- The maximum $\pi$ is then given by

   $$\pi^{*}=-10 - \frac{(75 - q_2)^{2}}{4(-2)}=\frac{(75 - q_2)^{2}}{8} - 10$$

### Remarks

- I don't care which one you use

- Using Calculus will also work for games with more complex payoff functions^[We will restrict ourselves to quadratics]

## The Cournot Duopoly Model

### Setting

- So far, our discussion of games has only included games with finite strategy spaces^[Technically speaking, finite action spaces; the strategy spaces are _discrete_]

- There is a natural setting in which we can explore games with [_continuous_]{.hi} action spaces

- Competition in a Duopoly

- In EC 311, you may have looked at firms maximizing profits subject to demand and marginal costs

   - Similar to agents maximizing expected utility, things look a little different under the lens of strategic interaction

### The model

- Consider two firms, $F_1$ and $F_2$, producing some good $X$

- The firms choose an _amount_ to produce, which we will call $q_1$ and $q_2$, respectively

- Let $Q=q_1+ q_2$ denote the total amount of $X$ produced in the market

### Costs
- Each firm faces cost function $c_i(q_i)$

   - Notably, $c_i$ may be firm-specific, but I may still use $c(q)$ for notational convenience

   - We will restrict ourselves to cases where the cost function is at most quadratic in $q_i$

- When $c_i(q_i)$ is linear

   - $c_i(q_i)=a+bq_i$

   - $a$ is the [fixed cost]{.hi}

   - $b$ is the [marginal cost]{.hi}

### Prices

:::{.panel-tabset}

#### Pricing Model

- The price that the firms can sell for in the market is entirely determined by the demand function, $P(Q)$

- Outside of monopolies, economists typically model firms as choosing only one of price and quantity, not both

- Though it might seem more natural to consider price competition, it takes a little bit of complexity to get such games to an interesting level

   - In game theory, this is called the [**Bertrand Model**]{.hi} of price competition, and I'll leave it for you to read in the text

#### Pricing Function

- Let's back up a second: suppose that market price, denoted $P$, is the output of some function of market quantity, $f(Q)$

   - That is, price varies with quantity; if you want to know the price, you have to plug in a specific $\overline{Q}$ into $f$ to get $f(\overline{Q})=\overline{P}$. 

- In many settings, this function that maps $Q$ to $P$ is simply given by [market demand]{.hi}

- Instead of talking about an arbitrary $f$, economists use $P(Q)$ to denote this demand function



#### Demand Function

- You will often see economists call $P(Q)$ the [**Inverse Demand Function**]{.hi}, reserving [_Demand Function_]{.alert2} for $Q(P)$

   - For instance, these both represent the same demand line:

      - Inverse demand: $P(Q)=100-2Q$ (often just $P=100-2Q$)

      - Demand: $Q(P)=Q=50-\frac{P}{2}$

\
\

- I'm not huge on this distinction, but I may use the term "inverse demand" from time to time; just know that it means _the demand function written in a specific way_

:::

### The model (cont.)

:::{.nonincremental}
- Two firms, $F_1$ and $F_2$, producing 

- Each firm $F_i$ chooses an _amount_ to produce, $q_i$

- Let $Q=q_1+ q_2$ denote the total amount of [X] produced in the market
:::

- Costs are given by some cost function $c_i(q_i)$, which is at most quadratic in $q_i$

- Prices are determined entirely by (inverse) demand, $P(Q)$

### Example

- Two firms, Vapenite and Jul-or-ee are competing to produce vaporizers for children

- The firms face identical cost functions $c_i(q_i)=10q_i$, and market demand is given by $Q=100-P$

- What is each player's payoff function?

. . . 

![](imgs/bznz_meme.jpg){fig-align="right", width=30%}


### The Firm's Problem

- Payoff function = profit function
   - Revenue: _price_ $\cdot$ _quantity_
      - Price: $Q=100-P$ $\implies$ $P=100-Q$
      - Revenue: $P(Q)\cdot q_i=(100-q_1-q_2)q_i$
   - Costs: $c_i(q_i)=10q_i$

- Therefore, each firm is simultaneously solving  

   - $\max_{q_i} (100-q_1-q_2)q_i - 10q_i$

- How do we proceed?

- Notice: $\pi_1(q_1, q_2)=-q_1^2 + 100q_1-q_2q_1-10q_1)$
   - $\pi_1(q_1, q_2)=-q_1^2 + (90-q_2)q_1$

- It's a quadratic with $a=-1$ and $b=90-q_2$

- Each firm effectively takes the other's quantity as given, so we just need to find $q_i$ which maximizes $\pi_i$ for each player
