## Last Time

### The Cournot Model

- Two firms, $F_1$ and $F_2$, producing good $X$

- Each firm $F_i$ chooses an _amount_ to produce, $q_i$

- Let $Q=q_1+ q_2$ denote the total amount of $X$ produced in the market


- Costs are given by some cost function $c_i(q_i)$, which is at most quadratic in $q_i$

- Prices are determined entirely by (inverse) demand, $P(Q)$

### Example

- Two firms, Vapenite and Jul-or-ee are competing to produce vaporizers for children

- The firms face identical cost functions $c_i(q_i)=10q_i$, and market demand is given by $Q=100-P$

- What is each player's payoff function?

### The Firm's Problem

- Payoff function = profit function
   - Revenue: _price_ $\cdot$ _quantity_
      - Price: $Q=100-P$ $\implies$ $P=100-Q$
      - Revenue: $P(Q)\cdot q_i=(100-q_1-q_2)q_i$
   - Costs: $c_i(q_i)=10q_i$

- Therefore, each firm is simultaneously solving  

   - $$\max_{q_i} (100-q_1-q_2)q_i - 10q_i$$

- Notice: $\pi_1(q_1, q_2)=-q_1^2 + 100q_1-q_2q_1-10q_1$
   - $\pi_1(q_1, q_2)=-q_1^2 + (90-q_2)q_1$

- It's a quadratic with $a=-1$ and $b=90-q_2$



## Solving Cournot Models

### Next Step

- How do we proceed?
   - Each firm effectively takes the other's quantity as given
   - So we just need to find $q_i$ which maximizes $\pi_i$ for each player

- Using our formula for the vertex of a parabola ($x$-value)^[AKA Arg. Max.]: 
   $$\hat{q}_1=-\frac{90-q_{2}}{2(-1)}=\frac{90-q_2}{2}$$

. . . 

![](imgs/bttf.gif){fig-align="center" width=45%}

### _What the hell is even that?_

- As a _function_ of $q_2$:
$$\hat{q}_1(q_2)=-\frac{90-q_{2}}{2(-1)}=\frac{90-q_2}{2}$$

   - Takes opponent's strategy as an input
   
   - Output's my own strategy, which maximizes my payoff (given my opponent's input strat.)

- What is this?

   - It's a [**Best Response Function**]{.hi}

- From now on, I'm going to ask you for BR function
   - This means finding arg. max (either using vertex rule or calculus)

### $BR_2$

$$\hat{q}_1=\frac{90-q_2}{2}$$

- Similarly, $\pi_2(q_1, q_2) = (100-q_1-q_2)q_2 - 10q_2$
   - $=-q_2^2 + (90-q_1)q_2$

   - $$\hat{q}_2=-\frac{90-q_{1}}{2(-1)}=\frac{90-q_1}{2}$$

- Now what?
   - 2 Equations, 2 unknowns
   - Solve simultaneously
      - Elimination
      - Substitution

### NE

- 
   \begin{align*}
   q_1 = \frac{90-q_2}{2} &= 45 - \frac{1}{2}(\frac{90-q_1}{2})\\
   &= 45 - \frac{90}{4} +\frac{q_1}{4}
   \end{align*}
\

- $\implies$
   \begin{align*}
   \frac{3}{4}q_1 &= \frac{90}{4}\\
   q_1^{*}&=30
   \end{align*}

\

- $q_2^* = \frac{90 - q_1^*}{2} = \frac{90-30}{2}=30$

### Profits

- So, $(q_1^*, q_2^*) = (30,30)$ is our Nash Equilibrium

- What are equilibrium profits?
   - Can compute $\pi_i^*=\pi_i(q_1^*, q_2^*)$
   - Or can use formula for the $y$-value of a parabola's vertex: $c-\frac{b^2}{4a}$
      - $\pi_1=-q_1^2 + (90-q_2)q_1$
      - $a=-1$, $b=(90-q_2)=60$, and $c=0$
      - $\pi_1^*=\frac{60^2}{4}=900$
      - Notice that profits (and strategies) are symmetric


## Ex 2: Heterogeneous Firms

### Consider another Example

- Demand: $P+Q=60$

- This time, firms are heterogeneous in their costs:
   - $c_1(q_1)=2q_1^2$
   - $c_2(q_2)=33q_2$


### Profit Functions

- Demand: $P=60-Q$

- Therefore, firm profits are given by
   - $$ \pi_1(q_1, q_2) = (60-q_1-q_2)q_1-2q_1^2$$

   - $$ \pi_2(q_1, q_2) = (60-q_1-q_2)q_2-33q_2$$

### Best Responses --Firm 1

- Profits: 
   - $\pi_1(q_1, q_2) = -3q_1^2 + (60-q_2)q_1$

:::{.panel-tabset}
#### Calculus

- First, take the derivative and set it equal to 0: 
   $$\frac{d\pi_1}{dq_1}=-6q_1+(60-q_2)=0$$

   - $$ q_{1}^{BR}=\frac{60-q_2}{6} $$

#### Algebra

- Using formula: $a = -3$, $b=(60-q_2)$, $c=0$
   - $$ q_{1}^{BR}=-\frac{60-q_2}{2(-3)}=\frac{60-q_2}{6} $$

:::

### Best Responses --Firm 2

- Profits: 
   - $\pi_2(q_1, q_2) = -q_2^2 + (27-q_1)q_2$

:::{.panel-tabset}
#### Calculus

- First, take the derivative and set it equal to 0: 
   $$\frac{d\pi_2}{dq_2}=-2q_2+27-q_1=0$$

   - $$ q_{2}^{BR}=\frac{27-q_1}{2} $$

#### Algebra

- Using formula: $a = -1$, $b=(27-q_1)$, $c=0$
   - $$ q_{2}^{BR}=-\frac{27-q_1}{2(-1)}=\frac{27-q_1}{2} $$

:::

### NE

We have 
$$
\begin{cases}
q_1=\frac{60-q_2}{6}\\
q_2=\frac{27-q_1}{2}
\end{cases}
$$

. . . 

$$
q_1 = \frac{60 - \frac{27-q_1}{2}}{6}\\
$$

\
\
\
\ 
\

. . .

$$q_1^{*}=\frac{93}{11}$$

### NE (cont.)

- $$q_2 = \frac{27-q_1}{2}$$
   - $$q_2 = \frac{27 - \frac{93}{11}}{2}$$

\
\
\
\

- $$q_2^{*}=\frac{102}{11}$$


### Equilibrium Profits

- $q_1^{*}=\frac{93}{11}$, $q_2^{*}=\frac{102}{11}$
   - $\pi_1(q_1, q_2) = -3q_1^2 + (60-q_2)q_1$
   - $\pi_2(q_1, q_2) = -q_2^2 + (27-q_1)q_2$

- $$\pi_1^{*} = \frac{(60-q_2^*)^2}{12}$$
   - $\pi_1^*\approx 214.43$
- $$\pi_2^{*} = \frac{(27-q_1^*)^2}{2}$$
   - $\pi_2^*\approx 171.97$

## Ex 3

### Setup

- Demand: $Q = 120 - 3P$

- Costs:
   - $c_1(q_1)=5q_1+10$
   - $c_2(q_2)=10q_2+5$



### Work
- Demand: $Q = 120 - 3P$
- Costs:$c_1(q_1)=5q_1+10$ and $c_2(q_2)=10q_2+5$




### Solution

:::{.panel-tabset}
#### Profits

$$\pi_1(q_1, q_2) = (40 - \frac{q_1}{3} - \frac{q_2}{3})q_1 - 5q_1 -10$$

$$\pi_1(q_1, q_2) = (40 - \frac{q_1}{3} - \frac{q_2}{3})q_2 - 10q_2 - 5$$

#### BRs

$$q_1^*= \frac{105-q_2}{2}$$

$$q_2^* = \frac{90-q_2}{2}$$


#### NE

$$q_1^*= 40$$

$$q_2^* = 25$$


#### Profits
$$\pi_1^*=10 - \frac{(35 - \frac{1}{3}(25))^2}{-4(1/3)} = 543.\bar{3}$$

$$\pi_2^*=5 - \frac{(30 - \frac{1}{3}(40)^2)}{-4(1/3)} = 213.\bar{3}$$

## Application: Cartels

### Setting

- Return to our first example:

   - $P=100-Q$

   - $c_i(q_i)=c(q)=10q$ for $i=1,2$

### Monopoly

- Suppose there is just one firm in the market, acting as a monopolist

- The monopolist chooses $q^*$ to maximize

   $$ (100 - q)q - 10q $$

- ...

- $q_M^* = \frac{90}{2}=45$
- $\pi_M^*=2025$

### Cournot

- Now, suppose that there are two firms in the market, competing for profit

- We solved this already

- $q_1^*=q_2^*=30$

- $\pi_1^*=\pi_2^*=900$

### Collusion

- Now suppose that the firms have the option to [collude]{.hi}

- When firms collude, they operate as monopoly, but split the production and profit between them
   - $\tilde{q}_1=\tilde{q}_2=\frac{q_M}{2}$
   - $\tilde{\pi}_1=\tilde{\pi}_2=\pi_i(\frac{q_M}{2}, \frac{q_M}{2})$
\
\
\

- In our example, this means each firm produces $\tilde{q}=22.5$ and earn profits of 
   $$\tilde{\pi}=(100-q_M)\frac{q_M}{2}-10\frac{q_M}{2}=\frac{\pi_M}{2}=\frac{2025}{2}=1012.5$$


### Will firms collude?

- Despite this benefit from colluding, each firm has an incentive to deviate in a one-shot game

- To see this, consider a one shot game of choosing production. Take as given that firm 2 is trying to collude by producing $\tilde{q}=\frac{q_M}{2}$

- Then, firm 1's profits are given by 
   $$\pi_1(q_1, \tilde{q})=(100-q_1-\tilde{q})q_1-10q_1$$

- What should firm 1 do?

### Will firms collude? (cont.)

- We can find the arg. max. for firm 1's profits:
   - $q_1^{D}=\frac{90-\tilde{q}}{2}=45-\frac{q_M}{4}=\frac{3}{4}(45)=33.75$

- This gives firm 1 profits of $$\pi_1^D=\left(100-\frac{3\cdot45}{4}-\frac{45}{2}\right)\frac{3\cdot45}{4}-10\left(\frac{3\cdot45}{4}\right)=\frac{18225}{16}$$
   - Or $$\pi_1^D=(100-33.75-22.5)(33.75)-10(33.75)=1139.0625$$

- This is bigger than the profits from colluding, so mutual collusion can't possibly be the Nash Equilibrium

### Repeated Interaction

- Now suppose that the two firms in this example are playing this game of production [_repeatedly_]{.hi}, where the chance of playing again next period (as opposed to being done forever) is given by $\delta>0$

- Consider the following trigger strategy:
   - Play $\tilde{q}=\frac{q_{M}}{2}$ in the first period
	   \begin{cases}
         \text{If $\tilde{q}$ is all that has been played thus far, then play $\tilde{q}$}\\
         \text{Otherwise, play $q^{*}$ (traditional Cournot output)}
	   \end{cases}

- In words: "collude until someone deviates, and then play Cournot forever"

- Can the firms stick to this strategy and collude forever?

### Analysis

- If firms stick with grim trigger, they each get 
   $$\tilde{\pi}+\tilde{\pi}\delta+\tilde{\pi}\delta^2+\cdots = \frac{\tilde{\pi}}{1-\delta}$$

- Assuming no one has deviated before, a firm deviating (to their best possible deviation) would receive
   $$\pi^D+\pi^*\delta+\pi^*\delta^2+\cdots=\pi^D + \frac{\pi^*\delta}{1-\delta}$$

- When will firms collude by using this trigger strategy?
   - When $$\frac{\tilde{\pi}}{1-\delta} > \pi^D + \frac{\pi^*\delta}{1-\delta}$$

## No Class Monday

### Stackelberg

- No class Monday, but here is some food for thought

- Consider the Cournot game, but player 1 has to pick $q_1$ first. Player 2 gets to observe $q_1$ first, before picking $q_2$. 

- Who would you rather be?
