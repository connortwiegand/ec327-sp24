## Last Time

### Matching Pennies

- There is no Nash Equilibirum in pure strategies

   - Not to be confused with subgame-perfect Nash Equilibria (SPNE), we may refer to pure strategy Nash Equilibria as [**PSNE**]{.hi}

- What do we do?

   1. Assume Bean is playing a mixed strategy
      
      - Compute Sean's expected payoffs in response to Bean

      - Use these to find when Sean could be induced to play a mixed strategy 

   2. Assume Sean is playing a mixed strategy

      - Compute Bean's expected payoffs in response to Sean

      - Use these to find when Bean could be induced to play a mixed strategy 

   - When [both]{.ul} players play (mixed) strategies that induce the other player to mix, we called this our [**MSNE**]{.hi}

### Example 1: BoS

Let's find all NE in BoS

- First things first: check for PSNE

   - (R,R) and (F,F) are NE

:::{.panel-tabset}

#### Step 1-0
- Suppose player 2 is playing $\tau=qR+(1-q)F$

   - $E[u_1(R, \tau)] = 3q+(1-q)=1+2q$

   - $E[u_1(F, \tau)] = 0+2(1-q)=2-2q$

- Player 1 mixes when these expected payoffs are equal

#### 1-1

\begin{align*}
   E[u_1(R, \tau)]&=E[u_1(F, \tau)]\\
   1+2q&=2-2q\\
   4q&=1\\
   q&=\frac{1}{4}
\end{align*}

- Player 1 mixes when $q=1/4$, ie when player 2 is playing $\frac{1}{4}R+\frac{3}{4}F$

#### Step 2-0
- Suppose player 1 is playing $\sigma=pR+(1-p)F$

   - $E[u_2(\sigma, R)] = 2p$

   - $E[u_2(\sigma, F)] = p+3(1-p)=3-2p$

- Player 2 mixes when these expected payoffs are equal

#### 2-1

\begin{align*}
   E[u_2(\sigma, R)] &=E[u_2(\sigma, F)]\\
   2p&=3-2p\\
   4p&=3\\
   p&=\frac{3}{4}
\end{align*}

- Player 2 mixes when $q=3/4$, ie when player 1 is playing $\frac{3}{4}R+\frac{1}{4}F$

### Example 1: BoS (cont.)

- When player 1 is playing $\sigma(3/4)=(3/4)R+(1/4)F$, player 2 is indifferent between their pure strategies, so they can be induced to mix

- When player 2 is playing $\tau(1/4)=(1/4)R+(3/4)F$, player 1 is indifferent between their pure strategies, so they can be induced to mix

- So, when players are playing $\{\sigma(3/4), \tau(1/4)\}$, both players are indifferent between any other strategies they could play

   - In other words, no one can deviate for strictly higher payoffs

- Hence, $$\{\sigma(3/4), \tau(1/4)\}$$ is our MSNE

[](imgs/bos.png){fig-align="right" width=40%}


### Fun fact: an Oddity

- We already know that some form of NE exists in every normal-form game

- How many exist?

- A fun, wild theorem was proven in the '80s: if you populate a normal form game of any size with random values, the probability of getting a game with an odd number of NE is [1]{.hi}

   - Note: that _doesn't_ actually mean always, it just means it's very unlikely that you get a game with an even \# of equilibria

## Visualizing MSNE

### 

- Visualizing mixed strategies will give us a lot of information about our game in question

- There are two types of graphs which we are interested in drawing:

   1. Expected payoff graph

   2. Best response plot

- We will focus on first one today

### Expected Payoff Graph

- Suppose opponent is playing a mixed strategy involving only two pure strategies

   - ex:  $\tau(q)=qX+(1-q) Y$

- _Idea:_ graph the expected payoff of playing each of one's pure strategies in response to this mixed strategy against the probability parameter
   - e.g. plot $E[u_i(s, \tau)]$ on the y-axis, and $q$ on the x-axis. 

- Ex: For BoS, we found

   - $E[u_1(R, \tau)] = 1+2q$

   - $E[u_1(F, \tau)] = 2-2q$

- So, let's plot each of these against $q$

   - _Note:_ let's de-clutter some notation: 
      - we know we are taking expected values
      - we know the opponent is playing a mixed strategy, and the name isn't all too important

### Expected Payoff Graph for BoS
Player 1's expected payoff from playing ...

- $R$ in response to $\tau$ is $u_1(R) = 1+2q$ 
- $F$ in response to $\tau$ is $u_1(F) = 2-2q$

### BR from a graph

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width=70%}
- Where the lines intersect = where player 1 is indifferent between playing $R$ and playing $F$

   - This is exactly $q=0.25$, like we found

- What else?

- _What happens when_ $q\neq0.25$?

   - When $q<0.25$, the payoff of playing $F$ exceeds that of playing $R$

   - When $q>0.25$, the payoff of playing $R$ exceeds that of playing $F$

- With this info, we can now build player 1's Best Response as a function of $q$: 
   $$ BR_1(q)=
      \begin{cases}
         F & q<0.25\\
         \{R,F\} & q=0.25\\
         R & q>0.25
      \end{cases}
   $$

## Sketching E.P. Graphs

### Sketching E.P. Graphs

- It's easier than you think to sketch one of these from a game table

. . . 

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width=50%}
![](imgs/bos-var2.png){width=90%}
:::


:::{.column width=50%}

<iframe src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/2rg9czrcvh?embed" width="400" height="400" style="border: 1px solid #ccc" frameborder=0 data-external="1"></iframe>

:::
::::

- Read from [bottom to top]{.ul}, the payoffs for each strategy match the left-to-right values on the graph


### Another Example

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width=50%}
![](imgs/bos-var1.png){width=90%}
:::


:::{.column width=50%}

<iframe src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/qlrxqp4t0h?embed" width="400" height="400" style="border: 1px solid #ccc" frameborder=0 data-external="1"></iframe>

:::
::::

- Similarly: For player 1, the payoffs for each strategy, read from [right to left]{.ul}, match the left-to-right values on the graph

### Why?
- Our arbitrary mixed strategies simply mimic the definition of a line 

- For starting point $p_1$ to end point $p_2$, a line can be parameterized according to $$tp_1 + (1-t)p_2$$ for $t\in[0,1]$

- Our mixed strategies are just linear combinations of pure strategies, but I digress

- The fact that we have to read the tables "backwards" is because we put $q$ on the "first" strategy^[For this reason, some authors choose to denote mixed strategies as $(1-q)X+qY$]

## More info from E.P. Graphs

### Best response

- We already saw one connection between the the expected payoff graph for a player and the player's BR function

- As it turns out, the entirety of a player's best response function is baked into this graph

   - For a given $q$ value, we can trace up to the highest line on the expected payoff graph at the point $q$: this is our best response!


### The Upper Envelope

- What's more: focus on the highest lines for any given $q$ value, and stitch these together

- This generates what is called the [**Upper Envelope**]{.hi} for a graph, and let's us get direct information on the best response function

- Ex: Consider the following expected payoff graph

   - Assume it's for some player with access to strategies $X$, $Y$, and $Z$

   - In response to a strategy of the form $\sigma=pA+(1-p)B$

## Dominance and Non-Rationalizability in Expected Payoff Graphs

### Bigger example

- Let's take a look at the following example -- it's big

- Assume that you drew this graph from some payoff matrix

<iframe src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/kmpwqbrxqd?embed" width="500" height="500" style="border: 1px solid #ccc" frameborder=0 data-external="1"></iframe>

### Observations

The fact that some lines sit completely (or mostly) above each other tell us information about dominated strategies for player 1
   - $A$ is strictly dominated by $B$ and $D$

   - $B$ is weakly dominated by $D$

   - $C$ is strictly dominated by $D$ and $E$

- What about $E$?^[This was the yellow $G$ in class]

   - Will you ever play it? 

      - No, not in upper envelope (so not in BR function)

   - Does anything dominate

      - Also no

   - Can we get rid of it?

### Recall

- At the end of week 3 (slide deck 6), we saw the following information 

:::{.panel-tabset style="color:gray"}
#### Sd-6
- [Def]{.def} [[Version 1.0]{.alert}]: A (pure) strategy $\tilde{s}\in S_{i}$ is said to be [Never a Best Response]{.hii} provided that $\tilde{s}\notin BR_{i}(s_{-i})$ for [any]{.ul} $s_{-i}\in S_{-i}$

- How is this related to strict/weak domination?

- [**Fact:**]{.alert} a strictly dominated strategy is never a best response
   - Why?

- Do we want to eliminate NBRs _a la_ IDSDS? 
   - No, at least not using this definition
   - We will return to this later, when we resume mixed strategies
:::

- Now, it's later

### Updated Definition

- [Def]{.def} [[Version 2.0]{.alert}]: A strategy is said to be [**Never a Best Response**]{.hi} provided that it is never a component of a player's best response function --- _taking into account mixed strategies_

   - In other words, a strategy is an [NBR]{.hi} provided that it isn't in the upper envelope of an agent's expected payoff graph

- For the updated definition, I will also use NBR interchangeably with [**non-rationalizable**]{.hi}

   - We could say an agent's strategy is [rationalizable]{.hi} if it _is_ in the upper envelope (/ is a component of the agent's best response function)

### The importance of rationalizability

- With this updated definition, we actually _can_ eliminate NBRs iteratively -- preserving all of the properties of IDSDS

   - However, since we are now in mixed strategy world, it is often not practical to do so

- In fact, eliminating NBR's in this manner is [equivalent]{.ul} to iteratively eliminating strictly dominated strategies

   - NBR $\implies$ strictly dominated. The strategy may be dominated _by a mixed strategy_

- Once again: the expected payoff graphs give us [a lot]{.ul} of information

### Using the Upper Envelope: An example
- The game:

![](imgs/fgh-ex.png){fig-align="right" width=30%}

- We have seen this game before. Recall: 

   - $BR_1(X)=F$
   - $BR_1(Y)=G$

- It is tempting to want to say that $H$ is Never a Best Response, because player 1 would always rather play something other than $H$ in response to a pure strategy

- Should player 1 ever play $H$?
