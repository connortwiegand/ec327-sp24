### Never Best Responses

- [Def]{.def} [[Version 1.0]]: 

- How is this related to strict/weak domination?

### Ex

[jump back](#sec-ex)

- $x \succsim_{W} y$ for _____
   - and y is NBR

- $z$ is not dominated by anything for ____
   - but $z$ is still NBR

### Never Best Responses

:::{.nonincremental}
- [Def]{.def} [[Version 1.0]]: 

- How is this related to strict/weak domination?
:::

- [**Fact:**]{.alert} a strictly dominated strategy is never a best response
   - Proof:

- [_Remark_]{.alert} we will return to this later

### Recall: BRs and NE

<!-- ## Mixed Strategies -->

### Matching Pennies

### Probabilistic Strategies

- Such a strategy is called a [Mixed Strategy]
- Contrast to Pure strategies -- what we have been discussing thus far
   - $s_{i}\in S_i$ denotes a pure strategy in a player's space of pure strategies
   - $\sigma_{i}(\cdot)\in \Sigma_{i}$ denotes a mixed strategy in a player's space of mixed strategies
- Mixed 

### When will I play a mixed strategy?

### Theorem

### How do we find MSNE?

- It's complicated...we'll return to this later

- For now, I primarily want you to know when/why players mix and Nash's theorem


### NE Example 2: Chicken

### NE Example 3 {#sec-ex}

### Stochastic Play

- What if players did not play every game the same way?
   - Think of Rock, Paper, Scissors

- Abstracting away from _how_ our opponent may make a randomized^[or _stochastic_] decision, let's simply model their strategy according to the probability that they select each of their moves

- E.g. $$ p_{H}H + p_{T}T $$

- This generates two new questions for us
   - What are probabilities are reasonable to play?
   - Why would someone play such a strategy?
