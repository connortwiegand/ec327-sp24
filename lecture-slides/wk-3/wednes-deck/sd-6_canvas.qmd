### Recall: BRs and NE

- Best response function: maps opponents' strategies to ones own best responses

- Nash equilibrium: 
   - Mutual (_intersection of_) best responses
   - No unilateral deviations


### NE: Chicken

- Let's practice underlining best responses again

### NE: Chicken --Solved

- NE: (RD, R) and (SG, S)

### NE-Ex

- This is a totally made up game, but it's good practice

### Matching Pennies

- Sean
   - $BR_S(H)=H$
   - $BR_S(T)=T$
- Bean
   - $BR_B(H)=T$
   - $BR_B(T)=H$

### Matching Pennies --Solved?

- So...there's no NE?
   - How do we make a good prediction?

### Probabilistic Play

- What if players did not play every game the same way?
   - Think of Rock, Paper, Scissors

- Abstracting away from _how_ our opponent may make a randomized^[or _stochastic_] decision, let's simply model their "random" strategy according to the probability that they select each of their moves

- E.g. $(p_{H})\cdot H + (p_{T})\cdot T$
   - That is, $p_{H}\equiv$ the probability that Sean plays Heads
   - Likewise, $p_{T}\equiv$ the probability that Sean plays Tails

### Mixed Strategies

- Such a strategy is called a [Mixed Strategy]{.ulb .hi}

- Contrast to _pure_ strategies -- what we have been discussing thus far
   - $s_{i}\in S_i$ denotes a pure strategy in a player's space of pure strategies
   - $\sigma_{i}(\cdot)\in \Sigma_{i}$ denotes a mixed strategy in a player's space of mixed strategies

- With mixed strategies, we now want to make explicit that we are thinking about players [expected]{.uli} payoffs

### Sean's Expected Payoffs

- Sean's strategy: let's call it $\sigma_S$: 
   $$\sigma_S=p_{H}H + p_{T}T$$

- What is $E[u_S(\sigma_S, H)]$? $E[u_S(\sigma_S, H)]$?
   - $E[u_S(\sigma_S, H)]= p_{H} \cdot u_S(H,H) + p_T \cdot u_S(T,H) = p_H - p_T$
   - $E[u_S(\sigma_S, T)]= p_{H} \cdot u_S(H,T) + p_T \cdot u_S(T,T) = p_T - p_H$

- This generates two new questions for us
   - What are probabilities are reasonable to play?
   - Why would someone play such a strategy?


### The importance of mixed strategies

- What Nash did for his dissertation 

- [**Theorem**]{.alert}: _Every "reasonable" game has a Nash Equilibria_
   - Remarks
      - I want you to assume that every game I show you in this class is "reasonable"
      - In particular, I'm never looking for the answer "this game does not have any NE"
      - Maybe none _of a certain flavor_ or _class_, but not "none"
   - "Reasonable"
      - Every game with a finite strategy space
      - If infinite strategies $\implies$ need compact strategy space^[basically...bounded + no holes]

### When will someone play a mixed strategy?

- Let's take for granted that Sean might be playing a mixed strategy

- Given this, Bean is thinking about playing a mixed strategy as well. When does it make sense to do so?
   - Let's compare $E[u_B(\sigma_S, H)]$ vs. $[u_B(\sigma_S, T)]$

1. Suppose $E[u_B(\sigma_S, H)] > E[u_B(\sigma_S, T)]$
   - What does this say in words?
   - "Bean gets a higher e.p.^[expected payoff] from playing H than T"
   - So: does Bean have any reason to play $T$?
      - No! That would be adding probability to a worse outcome
      - Bean should just play $H$

### When will someone play a mixed strategy? (cont.)

1. Suppose $E[u_B(\sigma_S, H)] > E[u_B(\sigma_S, T)]$
   - "Bean gets a higher e.p. from playing H than T"
   - So Bean should just play $H$

2. Instead suppose $E[u_B(\sigma_S, H)] < E[u_B(\sigma_S, T)]$
   - "Bean gets a higher e.p. from playing T than H"
   - Does Bean have any reason to play $H$?
      - No! Bean should just play $T$

- Should you ever play a mixed strategy that includes quitting?
   - Not if you want to win
   - "Juking out your opponent" doesn't work if it's too dumb

### When will someone play a mixed strategy? (cont.)

1. Suppose $E[u_B(\sigma_S, H)] > E[u_B(\sigma_S, T)]$
   - Bean should just play $H$
2. Suppose $E[u_B(\sigma_S, H)] < E[u_B(\sigma_S, T)]$
   - Bean should just play $T$
3. What if $E[u_B(\sigma_S, H)] = E[u_B(\sigma_S, T)]$?
   - What does this say in words?
   - "Bean is _indifferent_ between playing $H$ and $T$"

- If Bean gets equal (expected) payoffs from playing either pure strategy, then (and only then) will they have reason to play a mixed strategy

- This holds true in general:
   - An agent will only play a mixed strategy when they are indifferent between a subset of their pure strategies, _holding fixed what the other player is doing_
   - ...and, assuming these strategies are the best pure strategies they can play, in response to the opponent's strategy
      - Ex. scream $\sim$ cry, but **try** is better than both


### How do we find MSNE?

- It's complicated...we'll return to this later

- For now, I primarily want you to know when/why players mix and Nash's existence theorem


### Never Best Responses

- [Def]{.def} [[Version 1.0]{.alert}]: A (pure) strategy $\tilde{s}\in S_{i}$ is said to be [Never a Best Response]{.hii} provided that $\tilde{s}\notin BR_{i}(s_{-i})$ for [any]{.ul} $s_{-i}\in S_{-i}$

- How is this related to strict/weak domination?

### NBR Example

![](imgs/nbr-ex.png){.absolute top=10% right=5% width=33%}

- $H \succ_{SD} C$ for $P_A$
   - and $C$ is NBR

- Hit is not dominated by anything for $P_A$
   - but Hit is still NBR

### Never Best Responses

:::{.nonincremental}
- [Def]{.def} [[Version 1.0]{.alert}]: A (pure) strategy $\tilde{s}\in S_{i}$ is said to be [Never a Best Response]{.hii} provided that $\tilde{s}\notin BR_{i}(s_{-i})$ for [any]{.ul} $s_{-i}\in S_{-i}$

- How is this related to strict/weak domination?
:::

- [**Fact:**]{.alert} a strictly dominated strategy is never a best response
   - Why?

- Do we want to eliminate NBRs _a la_ IDSDS? 
   - No, at least not using this definition
   - We will return to this later, when we resume mixed strategies
