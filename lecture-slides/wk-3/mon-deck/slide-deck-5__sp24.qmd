## Best Responses

### Last time

- We got a mathy def. of best responses

- [Go there](#sec-br-def)

- Function vs. Correspondence

- [Some comments on choice in mathematics](#sec-mathabs)

- What does it mean?

### Visualization of $BR(\cdot)$

This photo shows some examples of maps ("functions") in set theory. Think of $S$ as being the set of opponents strategies, and think of $A$ as being the set of your strategies. Any of these could be valid BR functions. 

!![](imgs/set-theory-map.png){fig-align="center"}

- See next slide for more details


### Visualization of $BR(\cdot)$ (cont.)
- In words: the Best response function
   - Takes a particular strategy profile _from your opponents' strategies_ as an input
   - Spits out your best response

- What is a "best response"?
   - something that's at least as good as anything else you can do, _given the same input_

- put 2 + 2 together
   - Your best response function takes an opponents' strategy [profile] as an input, and outputs a subset of your strategies which are at least as good as all the others, if not better. 
   - E.g...(see next slide)

### Recall: Best Response Definition {#sec-br-def}

A [**Best Response Correspondence**]{.alert} (or [function]{.hi}) is a map for player $i$,
   
$$BR_{i}: S_{-i}\to S_{i}$$

such that, if $s_{i}^{BR}\in BR_{i}(s_{-i})$ (resp. [$s_{i}^{BR}= BR_{i}(s_{-i})$]{.hi})

then 

$$\pi_{i}(s_{i}^{BR}, s_{-i})\ge \pi_{i}(s_{i}', s_{-i})$$

for all $s_{i}'\in S_{i}$

### Pop Quiz

- T or F: Given some collection of opponents' strategies $\hat{s}$, the payoff for any one strategy in $BR_{i}(\hat{s})$ is the same as the payoff for any other strategy in $BR_{i}(\hat{s})$.

- _Answer: [T]{.hi}_

## Nash Equilibria --  Math


### To an equilibrium

1. [**Def**]: A [Nash Equilibrium]{.hii} is a set^[or _intersection_] of mutual Best Responses
   - E.g., a strategy profile is a [NE]{.hi} provided that all players are best responding to the other players' moves

2. Mathematically,

   - $s^{*}=(s_{1}^{*},\dots,s_{n}^{*})$ is a [NE]{.hi} if, $\forall i$, 

      $$\pi_{i}(s_{i}^{*}, s_{-i}^{*})\ge \pi_{i}(s_{i}', s_{-i}^{*})$$

      for any $s_{i}'\in S_{i}$

- [Compare to Best Response def](#sec-br-def)

### NE (cont.)

3. A strategy profile $s^{*}=(s^{*}_{1},\dots,s^{*}_{n})$ is a [NE]{.hi} provided that no player can unilaterally deviate from their strategy $s_{i}^{*}$ an receive a strictly better payoff (holding all other players' moves fixed)

- Aside: an equilibrium is [**always**]{.ul .alert} a strategy profile, [not]{.ul} a payoff (or payoff tuple)

### PD

::::::{.columns}

::::{.column width=55%}
- Start at $(Q,Q)$
   - $BR_A(Q)=S$, so Abed would deviate from $Q\to S$
- $(Q,S)$
   - $BR_T(S)=S$, so Troy would deviate from $Q\to S$
- $(S,S)$
   - $BR_T(S)=S$
   - $BR_A(S)=S$
- Therefore, $(S,S)$ is a Nash equilibrium
- Why?
   - Mutual best responses
      - $\color{red}{BR_T}(\color{blue}{BR_A}(\color{red}{S}))=\color{red}{S}$
   - No unilateral deviations to strictly higher payoffs

### PD (cont. )

![](tex-games/PD__solved.tex)

- $(S,S)$ is a Nash equilibrium
- Why?
   - Mutual best responses
      - $\color{red}{BR_T}(\color{blue}{BR_A}(\color{red}{S}))=\color{red}{S}$
   - No unilateral deviations to strictly higher payoffs

- Remark: We could have done this starting anywhere, or we could have started with Troy first instead of Abed

### Dominance and NE

- Recall the Iterated Deletion Method:
   - IDSDS never eliminates a ~~good prediction~~ [NE]{.hi}
   - If a unique strategy profile survives IDSDS, then it is the unique ~~good prediction~~ [Nash equilibrium]{.hi} for the game

## Nash Equilibria -- Solving

### Idea

- To help us keep track of best responses, we can simply underline the payoffs which correspond to best responses

### NE Example 1: BoS

::::::{.columns}

::::{.column width=40%}
![](tex-games/BoS.tex)

- $\color{red}{BR_A(F)=F}$
- $\color{blue}{BR_B(F)=\{F,B\}}$
