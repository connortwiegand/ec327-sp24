## Names

## IDSDS

### Recall

- Recall common knowledge assumptions

- If both players know the rules of the game, they can both work out dominated strategies

- Rational players won't play dominated strategies

- Idea: once both players figure this out, they should just _remove the dominated strategy from the game_

### Example^[slightly modified since last time]

::::::{.columns}
::::{.r-stack .column}
:::{.fragment .fade-out .absolute right="10"}
![](tex-games/ex1-4x4-v0.tex)
:::

:::{.fragment .absolute fragment-index=2 right="10"}
![](tex-games/ex1-4x4-v1.tex)
:::
::::

::::{.column width=60%}
:::{.nonincremental .fragment fragment-index=2}
- Recall that we said $C\succ_{D}B$ for Tim
:::

:::{.nonincremental .fragment fragment-index=3}
- Given that both players know this, we should simply proceed as if that row weren't there

::::{.column width=60%}
:::{.nonincremental .fragment fragment-index=1}
- Now what do we notice?
:::

:::{.nonincremental .fragment fragment-index=2}
- Since both players know that Tim will never rationally play $B$, 
   - [$Z\succ_{D} Y$]{.pl2} for Eric [(in the reduced game)]{.go}
:::

:::{.nonincremental .fragment fragment-index=3}
- ...so let's eliminate it!
:::
\

\

:::{.nonincremental .fragment fragment-index=5}
- Now what?
   - Rinse and repeat
:::

:::{.nonincremental .fragment fragment-index=6}
- Now  [$C\succ_{D} A$]{.pl1} for Tim
:::

:::{.nonincremental .fragment fragment-index=7}
- Given this,  [$X\succ_{D} W$]{.pl2} for Eric

1. [$C\succ_{D} B$]{.pl1} for Tim

- Is $(C, Z)$ a good prediction for the outcome of this game?
   - yes! 

- Are there any other good predictions for the outcome of this game?
   - probably not
   - we were pretty conservative in what we eliminated

- Does $X\succ_{D} W$ for Eric?
   - No
   - Only in the context of IDSDS

### Theorem

**Lemma:**

- IDSDS never eliminates a "good prediction"
   - keep this in mind for the homework

. . .

**Theorem:**

- If a [unique]{.ul} strategy profile survives IDSDS, then it is the unique "good prediction" for the game

- Games of this variety are often called [Dominance Solvable]{.hii}

. . .

**Corollary:**

- When performing IDSDS, order of operations does not matter
   - ...as long as you are following the rules of IDSDS

- Remark: it's okay to eliminate two strategies in a row for the same player

### Be clear

- Given this last theorem, make sure to [**clearly**]{.alert} list the order in which you are eliminating
   - In addition to being clear about which strategy you are eliminating...
   - ...for which player...
   - ...and why

### Example 2

### Example 3

## Towards a better Equilibrium

### BoS

- What do we do if there are no dominated strategies?

![](tex-games/BoS.tex)

### Motivation

- Players are rational optimizers (+ Common Knowledge)
   - Given the option to switch to a better outcome, they will take it

   - put another way: holding fixed their opponents move, players will [respond]{.hi} in the [best]{.hi} way possible

- Food for thought: if players were not best-responding, we would hardly be at something worth calling an equilibrium
   - Or: players wouldn't be rational

### Definition

A [**Best Response Correspondence**]{.alert} (or [function]{.hi}) is a map for player $i$,
   
$$BR{i}: S_{-i}\to S_{i}$$

such that, if $s_{i}^{BR}\in BR_{i}(s_{-i})$ (resp. [$s_{i}^{BR}= BR_{i}(s_{-i})$]{.hi})

then 

$$\pi_{i}(s_{i}^{BR}, s_{-i})\ge \pi_{i}(s_{i}', s_{-i})$$

for all $s_{i}'\in S_{i}$

### What. 


### NE 

- [**Def**]: A [Nash Equilibrium]{.hii} is a set (or intersection) of mutual Best Responses

- That is:

   - $s^{*}=(s_{1}^{*},\dots,s_{n}^{*})$ is a [NE]{.hi} if, $\forall i$, 

      $$\pi_{i}(s_{i}^{*}, s_{-i}^{*})\ge \pi_{i}(s_{i}', s_{-i}^{*})$$

      for any $s_{i}'\in S_{i}$

- Aside: an equilibrium is [**always**]{.ul .alert} a strategy profile, [not]{.ul} a payoff (or payoff tuple)
