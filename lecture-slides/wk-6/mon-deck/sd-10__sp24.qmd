### Kidnapper Game

Consider the following game

- Start by finding all Nash Equilibria

### Kidnapper Game (NE)

:::::{.columns}

::::{.column width=65%}
- What do the strategy spaces for each player look like?
   - $Kmr\in S_C$ and $|S_{C}|=2(2)(2)=8$
   - $P\in S_W$ and $|S_W|=2$

- So how big is our box?
   - 8x2

### Kidnapper Game (SPNE)

What about SPNE?

#### EFG

#### SPNE

![In the last stage of the game, the criminal will release if they are paid, and murder otherwise. Given this, the Wife will choose to Pay since 3>2. Therefore, in the first stage of the game, the Criminal is comparing 3 to 5 and decides to Kidnap because 5>3](imgs/kdnp_fi__spne.png){width=45%}

### The Centipede Game (Rules)

[Start]{.ul}

- Pot A has $2, pot B has $0
   - Throughout the game, players take turns playing "end" or "continue"

   - Playing "end" ends the game, and both players get all of the money in the pot they are holding

   - Playing "continue" adds $1 to each pot and both players swap pots

   - The total pool of money is $200. If both pots have $\ge \$99$ and the game continues, then both players receive $100 and the game ends

### The Centipede Game (E.F.)

Here is the previous game in extensive form

- Any Predictions?

- Where would you end?

![](imgs/centipede.png){width=40%}

### The Centipede Game (Analysis)

- In the last stage of the game, player 2 chooses to [end]{.pl2} rather than [continue]{.pl2} to get the extra dollar

- Knowing that player 2 will do this, player 1 will end the game a round early, yielding $(100, 98)$

- ...but player 2 can reason to this point^[common knowledge of sequential rationality], so they will end a round before that

- But what does player 1 do before this?

. . .

### The Centipede Game

- We continue this line of thought alllll the way back up the game 'tree'

- The result from backward induction is that player 1 ends the game on their first move

- This sort of phenomenon is commonly known as [**unravelling**]{.hi}

### Kidnapper Game w/ Imperfect Info.

Consider the following variant on the kidnapping game
- How many subgames are there?

### Kidnapper Game w/ Imperfect Info. (Subgames)

:::::{.columns}

::::{.column width=55%}
- Only 2 subgames^[recall that we can't break up information sets]

- Let's first consider the only _proper_ subgame
   - We have to be careful about whose payoffs are whose

### Quick Aside

:::::{.columns}

::::{.column width=55%}
- In [SG 1]{.hi}, each player has 2 strategies
   - neither player knows other's move before they make their own

- In [Aside]{.hi}, I have switched the Criminal and Wife
   - and, since I'm using colors, I could switch the order payoffs in either one of these diagrams^[as long as we make sure the structure of the game is still preserved -- e.g., the same players have the same payoffs]

- Keeping track of payoffs, how does the Normal Form representation of each of these Extensive Form games differ?
   - They don't!

- Takeaway?
   - EFGs with imperfect information capture elements of simultaneous-move play
