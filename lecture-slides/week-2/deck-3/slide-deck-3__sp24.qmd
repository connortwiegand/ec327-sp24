   - via _game tree_

- Freeform text

## Normal Form Representation

### Simultaneous-move games

- Games in normal form use a table-like box called a [payoff matrix]{.uli} 

- This representation is typically used to represent simultaneous-move games
   - Or stages of a game which can be modelled as simultaneous-move play

. . .

#### Structure of Simultaneous-move games

- Players move at the same time

- They play once and never again

- There is no prior communication between the players.

### A Normal Form Game

- We will start with so-called "2x2" games (really 2x2x2)
   - 2 players
   - each with 2 strategies

. . .

### Players


![](imgs/ex-game--players.png){fig-align="center" width=50%}

- Players:

   - Row player
      - [Player 1]{.pl1}
   
   - Column player
      - [Player 2]{.pl2}

### Strategies 

![](imgs/ex-game--strats.png){fig-align="center" width=50%}

### Strategies (Math)

- Strategies
   - Moves available to the player
   - In general, let $S_{i}$ denote player $i$'s [strategy space]^[or "set of strategies"]
      - Ex: $S_{1}=\{a,b\}$, $S_2=\{x,y\}$

### Strategy Profiles

[**Def:**]{.alert}
: - A [strategy profile]{.ulb} $s$ specifies a strategy for each player in the game
: - The [set of strategy profiles]{.ul}, $S$, is equal to 
   $$S=S_{1}\times\dots\times S_{n}$$

- Typically represented by an $n-$tuple: $s=(s_1,\dots,s_n)$ denotes a strategy profile where $s_1\in S_1$, $\dots$, $s_n\in S_n$
- Consider the strategy profile $(a,x)$
   - I may sometimes write $(ax)$, $ax$, or $a,x$ [if I feel it is clear to do so]{.uli}
      - Please clarify if you are unsure
      - Please try to be clear + consistent in your own notation, for your grader's sake

### Payoffs

![](imgs/ex-game--payoffs.png){fig-align="center" width=50%}

- Row player's payoff always listed first
   - In general, payoffs are in order of player number

### Payoffs (Math)

- Properly speaking, 
   $$\pi_i:S=S_{i}\times S_{-i}\to \mathbb{R}$$

- $S_{-i}$ denotes the set of strategies of all other players except for player $i$
   - $s_{-i}\in S_{-i}$ is one of such strategies

- We will keep order of inputs for $\pi_{i}$ independent of $i$:
   - $\pi_1(s_1,s_2)$ and $\pi_2(s_1,s_2)$
      - not: $\pi_2(s_2, s_1)$


## Towards an Equilibrium

### What is an equilibrium?

- What is our goal in modeling games?

- What do companies want you to be able to do with economic data? 

. . .

- Goal: come up with a good **prediction** for the outcome of a game


### What is a good prediction?

- Recall our assumptions: 
   - Common knowledge of the rules of the game
   - Common knowledge of rationality
   - Foreshadowing: given these two assumptions, should players experience regret at the end of a simultaneous-move game

- Key idea:

   - Let's start by thinking about _bad_ predictions, rather than good ones

## Dominated Strategies

### Definition

- A strategy $s_i, s_i'\in S_i$, we say [$s_i$ **strictly dominates** $s_i'$ for player $i$]{.ul} provided that 
   $$u_i(s_i, s_{-i})>u_{i}(s_i', s_{-i})$$

   for [all]{.ul} $s_{-i}\in S_{-i}$

- e.g., provided that $s_i$ does better than $s_i'$ for player $i$, [regardless of what my opponents do]

- [**Note:**]{.alert} players may share strategies -- or at least the abbreviation of a strategy -- therefore, it is important to include [which player we are talking about]{.hi} 
   - ..."for player $i$"

- I like using the preference symbol, $\succsim_{D}$, to denote domination:
   - "$s_{i}\succsim_{D} s_{i}'$ for player $i$" reads "$s_i$ dominates $s_i'$ for player $i$"

### Alt. Def. 

- The previous definition can also be reversed to construct the notion of **strictly dominated by**

- You can use $\succsim_{D}$ for free to mean "dominates". However, you must [clearly note]{.ul .alert} if you are using any shorthand for "is dominated by"

### Dominant Strategies

- Def: $s_{i}\in S_{i}$ is said to be **strictly dominant** if it strictly dominates all other $s_i'\in S_{i}$

- Dominant = better than everything else I can do, regardless of what my opponent does

### Weak Domination

- We can formulate any of the above definitions using the notion of [weak]{.ul} dominance

- This replaces $u_i(s_i, s_{-i})>u_{i}(s_i', s_{-i})$ with $u_i(s_i, s_{-i})\ge u_{i}(s_i', s_{-i})$

- There is a reason we don't want to do this, though
   - Forthcoming homework problem

- Note: Strict domination $\implies$ weak domination

## IDSDS

### Recall:

- Recall common knowledge assumptions

- If both players know the rules of the game, they can both work out dominated strategies

- Rational players won't play dominated strategies

- Idea: once both players figure this out, they should just _remove the dominated strategy from the game_

### IDSDS

- Iterated Deletion of Strictly Dominated Strategies
   - ~~Deletion~~ $\longrightarrow$ Elimination: IESDS
   - IDS/ISD if I'm lazy

- Consider the following game:
