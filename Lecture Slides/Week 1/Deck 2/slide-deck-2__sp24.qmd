## Intro

### What are examples of games?

- Ticket to Ride

- League

- Football

- Baldur's Gate

- Duopoly competition

- Job Market 

### Game theory Games

- Typically smaller-scale, isloated scenarios
   - Analyze a piece of a bigger game
   - In a vacuum (remember: modeling discipline)

\

- Prisoner's Dilema
- Matching Pennies
- Chicken
- Beer/quiche
- RPS
- How much college? (job market signaling)
- BoS

### Who Cares?

- Amazon
- Verizon
- Coke/Pepsi
- Valve

- Everyday Uses:
   - How should you fight family over the holidays?
   - How should you approach returning an item to a store?
   - When should you email your professor?

## What's in a Game?

### From last time...

- There are three things that are essential to specifying a game:

1. Players
1. Strategies
1. Payoffs

### Players

- Agents, users, etc. 

- To be a proper game, there should be [at least 2]{.ul} players

- [Ex]{.ex} Sukhjit is taking a penalty kick in soccer. There is a 50% chance the goalie defends left, and 20% chance they defend the middle, and a 30% chance they defend right. 

- This is something we might think of as a "game", but is really just a decision with some [exogeneity]{.hi}^[exogenous = 'falls from the sky'] from the environment

- Having two or more _real_ players is sometimes known as "strategic interaction"

### Strategies

- AKA
   - Moves
   - Actions

- What choices the player has 

- For now, the above terms can be treated as identical

- Later, when we get to sequential games, we will start using these terms with a little more care
   - Namely, a **strategy** is an [an information-contingent plan of action]{.uli}
   - An action is a _component_ of a strategy

- Typically finite, can be infinite
   - Ultimatum game, 2/3 avg, price-setting

### Payoffs

- Crucial to economics

- The payoff/utility^[We may use either of $u(\cdot)$ ("utility") or $\pi(\cdot)$ ("payoff")] obtained from a specific outcome in a game

   - (outcome = result of each player playing a pre-determined **strategy**)

- Can be specified via a function 
   - [Ex.]{.ex} $\pi(P,Q) = (100 + q_{1} + q_2) - 5q_1$

- Or a list
   - [Ex.]{.ex} Outcomes $(A, B, C, D)$ correspond to payoffs $(20, 40, 60, 80)$  
   - [Ex.]{.ex} $u(s_1, s_2)=$ `<value>` for each strategy $s_i$ that player $i$ could play

- Basically: a map from outcomes to numbers

## Assumptions in Game Theory

### Assumptions {.sp-45}

- Suppose that [you]{.pl1} and [I]{.pl2} represent the players in a game

- One mild assumption we would like to impose is that you and I are on the same page regarding the details of the game
   - e.g., the players, strategies, and outcomes

- We refer to these details as the [rules of the game]{.uli}

- But how do we formalize "on the same page"?

:::{.notes}
In 2/3 average game, everyone knew the rules of the game.

### The Rules of the Game

<ol>
   <li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4"> I know the rules of the game </li>
   <ul>
      <li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="6"> I know that you know the rules of the game </li>
      <li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="8"> I know that you know that I know the rules of the game </li>
      <li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="10"> I know that you know that I know that you know the rules of the game </li>
      <li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="12">...</li>
   </ul>


<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5">You know the rules of the game</li>
<ul>
   <li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="7"> You know that I know the rules of the game </li>
   <li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="9"> You know that I know that you know the rules of the game </li>
   <li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="11"> You know that I know that you know that I know the rules of the game </li>
   <li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="12">...</li>
</ul>
</ol>

### Common Knowledge of RotG

Let $\Gamma$ be a game with players $P_1,\dots,P_n$

[Assumption 1:]{.ul} Common Knowledge of the Rules of the Game

   - _Every statement of the form "player $i$ knows that player $j$ knows that ... player $k$ knows the rules of the game" is true_

### Assumptions, cont.

1. Common Knowledge of the Rules of the Game

2. Common Knowledge of **Rationality**

   a. I am rational
      - I know that you are rational
      - I know that you know that I am rational
      - ...
   b. You are rational
      - You know that I am rational
      - You know that I know that you are rational
      - ...

[... but what is rationality?]{.bottom}

### Rationality

What is it?

- [Players maximize their expected payoffs]{.fragment .strike}

. . . 

Technically speaking, rational agents are those who exhibit preferences which satisfy both of:

1. Completeness

2. Transitivity

### Wait, what?

. . .

Recall:

- In microeconomics, agents are said to have _preferences_ over goods (or _bundles_ of goods)

- We represent these preference relations with the $\succsim$ symbol, as follows

- For (bundles of) goods $x$ and $y$, consider Taylor's preferences:

   - $x\succsim y$ reads _"Taylor weakly prefers $x$ to $y$"_
      - or _"Taylor wants $x$ as least as much as $y$"_

   - $y\succsim x$ reads _"Taylor strictly prefers $y$ to $x$"_

- This allows us to define two more notions:

   - When $x\succsim y$ [and]{.ul} $y\succsim x$, we say
      - $x\sim y$: _"Taylor is indifferent between $x$ and $y$"_

   - When $x\succsim y$ but $y\not\succsim x$, we say
      - $x\succ y$: _"Taylor strictly prefers $x$ to $y$"_




### Rational Preferences

1. Completeness:

   - [Def]{.def} Given $x,y\in X$, an agent's preferences are **complete** provided at least one of the following is true:
      - $x\succsim y$
      - $y \succsim x$

   - [Ex.]{.ex}: [Jump to appendix](#sec-comp)

2. Transitivity:

   - [Def]{.def} Given $x, y, z\in X$, suppose that $x\succsim y$ and $y\succsim z$. Under these conditions, an agent's preferences are **transitive** provided that $x\succsim z$

   - [Ex.]{.ex}\
      Jake roots for the Lions when they play the Bengals, and the Bengals when they play the Bears. **But**, Jake roots for the Bears when they play the Lions


### Assumptions

...so...?

- We assume agents' preferences follow the classical assumptions of microeconomics...
   - (Players maximize their expected payoffs)

- Given this, our two assumptions moving forward are

   1. Common Knowledge of the Rules of the Game

   2. Common Knowledge of Rationality

- and that's it!

### Some Math Resources

- As-needed basis:
   - [Paul's online math notes](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/Alg/Alg.aspx) is [great]{.underline}
      - I have attached the link to the algebra section, but make sure to brief yourself with whatever you need (graphing, etc.). 

\

- Overkill, but will be helpful to skim through before next class:
   
   - [Set theory video 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyDKR4FG3Yw)

## Appendix

### Incomplete Preferences {#sec-comp visibility="uncounted"}

Via `economics.stackexchange`:

> Let $X$ be the number of possible baskets of goods that one can buy from a Walmart Superstore. Even if there were only 1,000 distinct items and we could only buy at most one of each item, that'd be $2^{1000}$ possible baskets. (Note that $X \gg 2^{1000}>10^{300}\gg10^{100}>$ "any estimate of the number of particles in the universe".)
>
> Even as a normative matter, it is debatable whether a perfectly rational being "should" have a complete preference ordering over these $X$ baskets.
>
> But as a positive matter, many (if not all) human beings will not have a complete preference ordering over these $X$ baskets.

### Extra 

:::{.nonincremental}

We introduced some set-theory notation on the chalkboard, including

- Sets 
   - e.g. $S=\{(a,b):\text{a is even, b is odd}\}$ reads "S is the set of all pairs $(a,b)$ such that $a$ is even and $b$ is odd"
   - I will use this $S$ for the examples below as well. 
- Elements of sets
   - e.g. $(6,10)\in S$ 
   - Importantly, $x\in[0,80)$ is the same as $0\le x < 80$
- The cartesian product of sets
   - If $E=\{\text{even numbers}\}$ and $O=\{\text{odd numbers}\}$, then $E\times O=S$

To introduce these concepts, we began discussing strategy spaces, strategy profiles, and the set of strategy profiles, but this will be covered formally at a later date (e.g. next week)
