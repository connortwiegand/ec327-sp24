Intro to Game Theory @ U/Oregon. 

Slide naming scheme:

- `sd-n__sp24` typically refers to the slides planned + presented at the time of lecture

- `slide-deck-n__sp24` and `sd-n_canvas` are used for the slides uploaded to the Canvas LMS, which may have any of the following:
   - Typos corrected from presented slides
   - Content added to reflect `chalkboard` drawings from lecture
   - Content removed if it was not covered in lecture
   - `embed_resources = true`
   - `incremental = false`
